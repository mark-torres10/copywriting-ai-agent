"""

writing_style_learner_prompt = """

You are an expert copywriter and writing coach. I will provide you with one or more articles written by my client. Your task is to analyze and learn the clientâ€™s writing style in a way that is specific, replicable, and objectively descriptive.

Please return a structured summary of the client's tone and style using the following dimensions:

1. **Tone** - Describe the emotional character of the writing (e.g., casual, witty, authoritative, skeptical). Be specific and give supporting examples.
2. **Sentence Structure** - Comment on average sentence length, punctuation patterns, and syntactic quirks. Do they use short punchy sentences or long, flowing structures?
3. **Lexical Choices** - Identify notable vocabulary, slang, or jargon. Are there recurring words or phrases? How formal or informal is the vocabulary?
4. **Voice and POV** - Note whether the client uses first, second, or third person voice. Is it conversational, editorial, or instructional?
5. **Persuasive Techniques** - Highlight any recurring rhetorical or persuasive techniques (e.g., questions, metaphors, analogies, humor, statistics).
6. **Formatting Style** - Describe how the writing is visually structured: headlines, subheaders, bullet points, bolding, etc.
7. **Examples and Patterns** - Include a few representative lines from the article(s) that showcase these elements.

The goal is to produce a writing style guide that could be handed off to a junior copywriter to reliably generate new content in the same voice.

Please make your response structured, specific, and as actionable as possible.
