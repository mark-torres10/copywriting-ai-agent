### Client Writing Style Guide

#### 1. **Tone**
- **Emotional Character**: The tone is **enthusiastic**, **informative**, and **supportive**. The writing conveys a sense of passion for the hemp industry and a commitment to quality and safety.
- **Examples**: Phrases like "we pride ourselves in our passion for the hemp plant" and "let us help you find your feel good!" reflect a positive and encouraging tone.

#### 2. **Sentence Structure**
- **Average Sentence Length**: The sentences vary in length but tend to be medium to long, often incorporating multiple clauses.
- **Punctuation Patterns**: The writing uses a mix of commas, dashes, and ellipses to create a conversational flow. There are instances of short, punchy sentences for emphasis, especially in promotional contexts.
- **Syntactic Quirks**: The use of dashes to add emphasis or additional information is common, e.g., "Gluten-free, non-GMO, and vegan... but most importantly-delicious."

#### 3. **Lexical Choices**
- **Vocabulary**: The vocabulary is a blend of **technical jargon** (e.g., "bioavailable," "entourage effect") and **accessible language**. The writing is mostly informal but maintains a level of professionalism suitable for the industry.
- **Recurring Words/Phrases**: Terms like "feel good," "safety," "quality," and "experience" are frequently used, emphasizing the brand's focus on consumer satisfaction and product integrity.
- **Formality**: The language is generally informal, aiming for relatability while still conveying expertise.

#### 4. **Voice and POV**
- **Point of View**: The writing primarily uses **first-person plural** ("we," "our") to create a sense of community and shared purpose with the audience.
- **Voice**: The voice is **conversational** and **engaging**, often addressing the reader directly, which fosters a connection.

#### 5. **Persuasive Techniques**
- **Rhetorical Techniques**: The writing employs questions, exclamations, and direct appeals to the reader (e.g., "Try it out today & feel the difference!").
- **Metaphors/Analogies**: While not heavily metaphorical, the writing uses relatable comparisons to explain complex concepts (e.g., "the feel-good factor").
- **Statistics and Evidence**: References to compliance and safety standards lend credibility, as seen in discussions about regulations and testing.

#### 6. **Formatting Style**
- **Visual Structure**: The writing uses **headlines**, **subheaders**, and **bullet points** to organize information clearly. This structure aids readability and allows for quick scanning of key points.
- **Emphasis**: Important phrases are often bolded or italicized to draw attention, and lists are used to break down complex information.

#### 7. **Examples and Patterns**
- **Representative Lines**:
  - "Our gummies provide a controlled & consistent dosage of cannabinoids every time - meaning they're just as easy to enjoy as they are to eat!"
  - "This proprietary process makes Formula-X experiences vivid and more euphoric than anything previously seen in the alternative cannabis category."
  - "Let us help you find your feel good!"
  - "We're focused on creating unique formulations - using only quality ingredients - to provide consumers with experiences they can love and rely on."
