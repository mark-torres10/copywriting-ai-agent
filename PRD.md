# ðŸ§  PRD: Brand Voice AI Agent â€“ Content Generation Platform

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Build a Streamlit-based AI system that:

- Learns a brand's tone and style from existing published content (URLs or raw text)
- Generates new content (e.g. blog posts, opinion pieces, product copy) on custom topics in that voice
- Optionally scores the generated copy using an LLM-based judge for tone and content quality
- Allows the user to export final copy to Google Docs (via pre-integrated Google API auth)
- Allows users to submit feedback on generated drafts to improve future generations

## ðŸ§© Key Features

- Brand Voice Ingestion
  - Input: URLs or pasted raw text of brand content
  - Process: Clean extraction of text; summarize tone, style, and rhetorical devices
  - Output: Structured "voice profile" used in future prompt templates

- Trend or Topic Input
  - Input: Manually typed, pasted, or URL-based input of a current topic or trend
  - Optional: Integrate trending topic scrapers (e.g., Reddit, Google News APIs)

- Voice-Driven Content Generation
  - Compose content in the ingested brand voice using the selected topic
  - Adjustable formats: blog, headline, opinion, product copy
  - Prompt includes voice profile + content objective

- LLM Judge Module (Optional)
  - Evaluates tone fit, content quality, brand alignment
  - Provides structured ratings + freeform feedback
  - Output visible in UI for QA/debugging

- Interactive Streamlit UI
  - Input brand URLs or text
  - Provide topic or paste link
  - Show generated content with side-by-side original copy
  - LLM scoring results
  - Export to Google Docs
  - Feedback: Includes a text box below the generated draft. Users can submit feedback on the generation . Submissions are saved as JSON records (includes prompt, draft, and feedback). These records are used to ground future prompts for improved tuning.

- Google Docs Export
  - Uses existing OAuth integration
  - Pushes generated output to user-selected Google Drive folder.

Proposed Streamlit layout:

- Single-page
- Series of interfaces
- User clicks on a series of buttons, one per article that we have saved already (the button should have a preview of the article title). When they click on it, the AI-generated summary of that article should appear.
- Then a button that says something like "Write a custom AI-generated blog post about this article". Then this should run
the logic in article_writer.py to generate the article.
- Underneath it, when the article is generated, there should be a feedback box as well as a "submit feedback" button. This should allow users to leave free-form text feedback if they want, and then also a thumbs up/down, if they want, and then they
can press submit. This should save a .json file. Ideally we create a data/tmp/{session_timestamp} and then create a JSON (name is {hashed_url}_{timestamp}.json), with the following keys:
  - metadata: metadata of the article (as a JSON dict)
  - text: article text
  - generated_text: text generated by the AI
  - feedback: the feedback given.
  - thumbs_up: boolean, whether they gave thumbs up or down.
  - thumbs_down: boolean, whether they gave thumbs up or down.
