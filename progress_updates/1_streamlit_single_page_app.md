# 1. Streamlit Single-Page App Implementation (2024-06-01)

## Summary
- Implemented a single-page Streamlit app for the Brand Voice AI Agent demo.
- Simplified the user flow: select an article, view its summary, generate an AI-written post, and provide feedback.
- Integrated precomputed brand writing style and article summaries.

## Implementation Details
- Refactored `app.py` to a single-page, minimal UI with no navigation or placeholders.
- Dynamically loads article summaries using `load_article_summaries` from `agents/article_writer.py`.
- Displays a button for each article; clicking the button selects the article and shows its summary.
- Added a clickable link (ðŸ”—) next to each article button to open the article in a new browser tab.
- Generates an AI-written blog post using `write_blog_post_about_article` from `agents/article_writer.py`.
- Displays the generated post and a feedback section (thumbs up/down, optional text, submit button).
- Saves feedback to `data/tmp/{session_timestamp}/feedback.json`.
- Shows the precomputed writing style guide in an expandable dropdown at the bottom of the page.
- Ensured modern, minimal, and accessible UI per project guidelines.

## Testing
- Manual testing of the full user flow:
  - Article selection and summary display.
  - Article link opens in a new tab.
  - AI-generated post creation and display.
  - Feedback submission and file creation in the correct directory.
  - Writing style guide displays correctly in a dropdown.
- No automated/unit tests yet for the UI layer.

## Remaining Work
- **Automated Testing:** Add unit/integration tests for backend logic and UI interactions.
- **Error Handling:** Improve user feedback for API or file errors.
- **UI Polish:** Add microinteractions, loading states, and further visual refinements.
- **Accessibility:** Further review for accessibility best practices.
- **Docs:** Update user and developer documentation as features evolve.
