        Texas House of Representatives Approves Ban on Hemp-Derived THC

        The Texas House of Representatives has passed an amended version of
        Senate Bill 3, reversing course from a committee-approved proposal to
        regulate hemp-derived THC products, instead reinstating a near-total
        ban similar to the version that passed the Senate in March.

        As passed by the House, the legislation would outlaw nearly all
        consumable products containing THC derived from hemp, including edibles,
        beverages, tinctures, and vapes. The bill carves out limited exceptions
        for products containing only trace amounts of THC, effectively removing
        most items currently sold in the state's multi-billion dollar hemp market.

        The Senate approved a slightly different version of the bill in March,
        which would also ban all hemp-derived THC products. However, it was
        amended in the House State Affairs Committee to instead be a THC
        regulation bill. Despite the committee's change, the full House approved
        an amendment to again ban, rather than regulate, hemp-based THC
        products.

        The legislation now returns to the Senate, which must decide whether
        to concur with the House changes or convene a conference committee to
        resolve differences.

        Lawmakers have until June 2, the end of the legislative session, to act.

        Nevada Legislature Passes Bill Allowing Those With Past Marijuana
        Possession Convictions to Work in Foster Care

        By a combined vote of 61 to 2, the Nevada Legislature has passed
        Assembly Bill 107, a measure that removes certain marijuana-related
        convictions from disqualifying individuals from working in or operating
        foster homes.

        AB 107 was approved by the state Senate on May 23 with a 19 to 2 vote,
        after having previously passed the Assembly unanimously in April, 42 to 0.
        It will now be sent to Governor Joe Lombardo for consideration.

        Under current law, individuals convicted of violating any law regulating
        controlled substances—including marijuana—were barred from residing in,
        being employed by, or operating a foster home. AB 107 revises this
        policy by allowing individuals with prior convictions for marijuana
        possession (not for the purpose of sale) to be eligible, so long as the
        offense occurred more than five years ago.

        The legislation updates state requirements for background checks
        conducted on applicants, employees, and adult residents of foster homes.
        It specifically excludes older marijuana possession offenses from the
        list of disqualifying crimes, provided the convictions did not involve
        intent to sell and did not occur within the past five years.

        Supporters say the bill helps remove outdated barriers created by
        now-obsolete marijuana laws, especially as Nevada legalized adult-use
        marijuana in 2016. The change is expected to expand the pool of
        qualified individuals who can support the state's foster care system
        while acknowledging broader changes in public attitudes and state policy
        regarding marijuana use.

        The bill takes effect immediately upon being signed by the governor.

        Minnesota Announces Reopening of Registration for Hemp-Derived Cannabinoid Businesses and Licensing Rollout for Low-Potency Hemp Edible Businesses

        Today, the Minnesota Office of Cannabis Management (OCM) announced
        that on June 2 it will open a new window for accepting registrations
        for businesses seeking to sell hemp-derived cannabinoid products (HDCPs)
        to consumers.

        Businesses that sell HDCPs but are not registered with the Office of
        Cannabis Management are in violation of Minnesota law and will be subject
        to enforcement action including the destruction of all the business' HDCPs
        and penalties of up to $10,000 for each violation, according to a press
        release from OCM.

        The second registration window will remain open until August 31, making
        it possible for unregistered businesses to become eligible to sell HDCPs,
        including hemp-derived THC beverages, during the busy summer season.
        OCM also announced that starting October 1 and continuing through
        October 31, it will accept business license applications for three
        license types: lower-potency hemp edible retailers, lower-potency hemp
        edible manufacturers, and lower-potency hemp edible wholesalers - the
        last of which is a new license type approved by the 2025 Legislature and
        signed into law by Governor Tim Walz on Friday, May 23.

        After a lengthy education and promotion campaign, OCM closed the first
        registration window on April 14 following the adoption of rules
        governing Minnesota's cannabis industry, which set in place OCM's
        ability to issue business licenses. With the announcement of the October
        window for lower-potency hemp edible (LPHE) licenses, OCM's decision to
        resume registrations creates an opportunity for businesses to enter the
        market. In addition to accommodating new registrants, the decision offers
        an opportunity for current registrants to update previously submitted
        registrations and remain in compliance with Minnesota law.

        "As we prepare to issue cannabis business licenses and the upcoming
        lottery on June 5 for license types that are capped in statute, we are
        leaving no one behind," said OCM Interim Director Eric Taubel. "Opening
        a registration window for new hemp retailers this summer allows hemp
        businesses to continue driving revenue and economic opportunities to
        the entire state."

        Once the registration window closes August 31, no new registrations or 
        changes to registration will be accepted during the month of September
        as OCM prepares for the conversion from a registration system to a full
        business license for lower-potency hemp edible retailers, manufacturers,
        and wholesalers.

        What this means for current HDCP retailers

        Current HDCP registrants who apply for an LPHE license will be able to
        continue to sell products compliant with Minnesota Statutes, section
        151.72, until they receive a license. Registrants who do not apply for
        a license must immediately end all sales of HDCPs on October 31.

        Upon licensure, all products and retail operations must comply with
        Minnesota Statutes, section 342.46; Minnesota Rules, part 9810.2503;
        and all other applicable laws. During the transition period, some
        retailers will operate under section 151.72 and others under chapter 342,
        depending on their licensure status. Retailers who apply for an LPHE
        license but were not previously registered will need to wait to commence
        operations until after they receive their LPHE license.

        Applicants must be in good standing with OCM in order to successfully
        convert their registration to a license, meaning they do not have any
        outstanding fines or open correction orders against them.

        Detailed instructions for registering a hemp business and applying for a
        lower-potency hemp edible business license are available on our website.

        Women with anorexia experienced a resurfacing of previously blocked
        traumatic memories during psilocybin-assisted therapy, leading to
        remission of their eating disorder symptoms, according to a new study
        published in the Journal of Eating Disorders.

        The pilot study involved 10 women diagnosed with anorexia nervosa or in
        partial remission. Each received a 25-mg dose of COMP360, a synthetic
        formulation of psilocybin, along with psychological support and
        integration therapy sessions. Researchers from the University of
        California, the Medical University of South Carolina, and King's
        College London conducted the study to assess the safety and early
        therapeutic potential of psilocybin treatment for anorexia.

        Two participants reported the emergence of previously dissociated
        memories of sexual trauma during the therapy. Processing these memories
        with professional support appeared to result in meaningful psychological
        breakthroughs. Both individuals achieved clinically significant weight
        gain and remission of their anorexia-related symptoms, as measured by
        the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), within three
        months of treatment.

        The findings suggest that psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy may help
        individuals not only manage eating disorders but also process
        unresolved trauma, particularly in cases involving dissociative amnesia.
        While the results are limited to a small sample, researchers say the
        outcomes warrant further investigation into psilocybin's role in
        treating both anorexia and trauma-related conditions like PTSD.

        "Psylocibin therapy may hold promise not only in the treatment of
        eating disorders but also trauma-related disorders, including PTSD
        and dissociative amnesia", concludes the study.

        A new study published in BMC Genomics explores how different parts of
        the marijuana plant influence the production of cannabinoids and
        terpenes, offering insight into the plant's internal regulatory
        mechanisms.

        Through a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of wild cannabis,
        researchers identified over 2,500 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
        across leaf, stem, and root tissues. These findings point to clear
        tissue-specific control over the pathways that produce cannabinoids and
        terpenoids.

        Genes essential for terpenoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis—such as
        terpene synthase (TPS) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL)—were found
        to be most active in leaf tissue, especially during the flowering stage.
        Validation through RT-PCR of ten key genes, including CBDAS and THCAS,
        confirmed strong expression in leaves, consistent with the idea that
        this photosynthetically active tissue is a primary site of cannabinoid
        synthesis.

        In addition to gene expression, the study analyzed alternative
        splicing (AS), uncovering 8,729 unique events, with exon skipping being
        the most common. Genes involved in terpenoid production displayed
        enriched splicing activity, suggesting that changes in RNA processing
        may fine-tune enzyme function and chemical output. The researchers
        note that further study is needed to confirm how these variations
        affect protein activity.

        The team also identified 3,245 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), many of
        which were expressed in specific tissues and found to co-occur with
        metabolic genes. These lncRNAs could play a regulatory role in
        cannabinoid and terpene production, though their functions in marijuana
        remain to be experimentally confirmed.

        Genetic analysis revealed more than 12,000 SNPs and nearly 2,800 INDELs,
        with several mutations found in critical biosynthetic genes like TPS and
        PAL. These genetic differences could help explain variation in chemical
        composition between different parts of the plant.

        Researchers conclude by stating:

        This study provides preliminary insights into the tissue-specific
        metabolic regulation of wild C. sativa through transcriptomic analysis.
        By identifying differentially expressed genes, alternative splicing events,
        lncRNAs, and genetic variations, it suggests potential regulatory
        mechanisms underlying secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The RT-PCR
        validation of key genes supports the reliability of the transcriptomic
        data. While further functional and multi-omics validation is necessary,
        these findings offer a valuable foundation for future research aimed at
        optimizing cannabinoid production and exploring therapeutic applications.

        Study: Regular Cannabis Use May Protect Brain Function in People With HIV

        According to a new study published in the peer-reviewed journal Brain
        Communications, regular cannabis use may help counteract some of the
        harmful neurological effects of HIV, particularly those related to
        inhibitory brain processing and gamma oscillatory activity.

        Researchers from the University of Nebraska and Creighton University
        analyzed brain activity in 108 participants—both cannabis users and
        non-users, with and without HIV—using magnetoencephalography (MEG)
        during somatosensory stimulation tasks. The findings showed that people
        with HIV (PWH) who used cannabis had stronger gamma oscillatory
        responses and more normalized spontaneous gamma activity in the primary
        somatosensory cortex compared to PWH who did not use cannabis.

        Notably, the study found that longer HIV disease duration was associated
        with reduced sensory gating efficiency—but only in non-cannabis users.
        Those who regularly used cannabis showed no such decline, suggesting a
        potential protective effect.

        Gamma oscillations, which help regulate brain processing and coordination,
        were significantly elevated in PWH who did not use cannabis—an abnormal
        pattern previously linked to cognitive decline and neurological disease.
        In contrast, cannabis users with HIV had gamma activity levels more
        consistent with those of participants without HIV.

        The study proposes that cannabis' interaction with CB1 and CB2 receptors
        may underlie these effects, potentially influencing GABAergic interneurons
        critical for producing gamma rhythms. While the authors note
        limitations—such as not measuring inflammation markers or exact timing
        of cannabis use—they emphasize that these results highlight the potential
        of cannabis as a neuroprotective agent in the context of HIV.

        "These findings provide new evidence that cannabis use may mitigate the
        harmful effects of HIV on oscillatory and spontaneous gamma activity
        serving inhibitory processing", concludes the study.
