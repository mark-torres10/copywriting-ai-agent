        New York Supreme Court Rules in Favor of Hemp Industry
        
        Hey everyone! Let's break down some big news from the hemp world in a
        way that's easy to understand.

        This past Thursday, the New York State Supreme Court made a decision
        that's a big deal for hemp companies. They stopped the New York State
        Cannabis Control Board (CCB) and some other state folks from using new
        rules they set up in July about how hemp products can be made and sold.
        These new rules were pretty strict. They said that hemp products must
        have a lot more CBD than THC (at least 15 times more) and put limits on
        how much THC can be in each serving and each product.

        Click here for full court ruling.

        The hemp companies, who we're calling the Hemp Parties, didn't agree
        with these new rules. They said these rules were made unfairly and
        didn't make sense. They also argued that the rules were made without
        good reasons and were just over the top.

        The court looked at three main things to decide if they should stop
        these new rules:

        Chance of Winning the Case: The court agreed with the Hemp Parties.
        They said the reasons given for these new rules didn't have solid
        evidence or facts showing that hemp products were causing problems or
        misleading people in New York.

        Risk of Harm Without Stopping the Rules: If the court didn't stop
        these rules, the Hemp Parties would have been really hurt. The rules
        could have shifted customers away from their products to others that
        the CCB liked better. This could have caused the Hemp Parties to lose
        their place in the market.

        Fairness: The court thought that if the rules stayed, the Hemp Parties
        might go out of business. This would be really hard on their workers,
        who might struggle to find new jobs in today's tough market.

        The court decided that it was only fair to side with the Hemp Parties.

        A big shoutout to North Fork Distribution, Cycling Frog, Sarene
        Craft Beer Distributors, the Hemp Beverage Alliance, One Stop Brew
        Shop, and their legal team for this victory.

        Here's the full court ruling for those who want to dive deeper:

        Remember, this is just a quick summary. The legal world can be complex,
        but we hope this helps you understand what's happening in the hemp
        industry!

        FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF AG CRACKING DOWN ON NEW PACKAGING LAWS

        In a determined move to protect minors from potentially enticing and
        dangerous substances, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson
        recently unveiled a substantial discovery. More than 8,700 packages of
        hemp-extract products, designed in a manner likely to captivate the
        attention of children, were found by inspectors from the Florida
        Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) at Top Private
        Labels Co. in Daytona Beach.

        The visually appealing yet questionably packaged products were promptly
        placed under a “stop sale order” to prevent their entry into the
        Florida market. Commissioner Simpson emphasized the critical need to
        safeguard the well-being of children and consumers, particularly from
        ingestible products that could pose severe risks when consumed by minors.

        To counter these risks, Commissioner Simpson collaborated with lawmakers
        during the 2023 Legislative Session, resulting in SB 1676. This
        legislation, sponsored by Sen. Colleen Burton and Rep. Will Robinson,
        garnered unanimous approval in both legislative chambers. Among its key
        provisions, the law upheld the age limit of 21 and imposed a statewide
        ban on packaging that might allure children. Moreover, it mandated safe
        packaging and enforced health and safety standards similar to those
        governing food products.

        FDACS has been vigilant in enforcing these measures, conducting
        extensive inspections of businesses selling hemp-extract products.
        The department's efforts included examining over 700 establishments across all 67 Florida counties, uncovering a substantial number—more than 107,400—of attractively packaged hemp products.

Florida’s proactive steps in reforming hemp laws and implementing stringent regulations exemplify a robust commitment to ensuring consumer safety and shielding children from potentially harmful substances. This crackdown underscores the state’s dedication to adapt and fortify regulatory frameworks in response to evolving market dynamics and emerging challenges.
