        New York Supreme Court Rules in Favor of Hemp Industry
        
        Hey everyone! Let's break down some big news from the hemp world in a
        way that's easy to understand.

        This past Thursday, the New York State Supreme Court made a decision
        that's a big deal for hemp companies. They stopped the New York State
        Cannabis Control Board (CCB) and some other state folks from using new
        rules they set up in July about how hemp products can be made and sold.
        These new rules were pretty strict. They said that hemp products must
        have a lot more CBD than THC (at least 15 times more) and put limits on
        how much THC can be in each serving and each product.

        The hemp companies, who we're calling the Hemp Parties, didn't agree
        with these new rules. They said these rules were made unfairly and
        didn't make sense. They also argued that the rules were made without
        good reasons and were just over the top.

        The court looked at three main things to decide if they should stop
        these new rules:

        Chance of Winning the Case: The court agreed with the Hemp Parties.
        They said the reasons given for these new rules didn't have solid
        evidence or facts showing that hemp products were causing problems or
        misleading people in New York.

        Risk of Harm Without Stopping the Rules: If the court didn't stop
        these rules, the Hemp Parties would have been really hurt. The rules
        could have shifted customers away from their products to others that
        the CCB liked better. This could have caused the Hemp Parties to lose
        their place in the market.

        Fairness: The court thought that if the rules stayed, the Hemp Parties
        might go out of business. This would be really hard on their workers,
        who might struggle to find new jobs in today's tough market.

        The court decided that it was only fair to side with the Hemp Parties.

        A big shoutout to North Fork Distribution, Cycling Frog, Sarene
        Craft Beer Distributors, the Hemp Beverage Alliance, One Stop Brew
        Shop, and their legal team for this victory.

        Remember, this is just a quick summary. The legal world can be complex,
        but we hope this helps you understand what's happening in the hemp
        industry!

        FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF AG CRACKING DOWN ON NEW PACKAGING LAWS

        In a determined move to protect minors from potentially enticing and
        dangerous substances, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson
        recently unveiled a substantial discovery. More than 8,700 packages of
        hemp-extract products, designed in a manner likely to captivate the
        attention of children, were found by inspectors from the Florida
        Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) at Top Private
        Labels Co. in Daytona Beach.

        The visually appealing yet questionably packaged products were promptly
        placed under a “stop sale order” to prevent their entry into the
        Florida market. Commissioner Simpson emphasized the critical need to
        safeguard the well-being of children and consumers, particularly from
        ingestible products that could pose severe risks when consumed by minors.

        To counter these risks, Commissioner Simpson collaborated with lawmakers
        during the 2023 Legislative Session, resulting in SB 1676. This
        legislation, sponsored by Sen. Colleen Burton and Rep. Will Robinson,
        garnered unanimous approval in both legislative chambers. Among its key
        provisions, the law upheld the age limit of 21 and imposed a statewide
        ban on packaging that might allure children. Moreover, it mandated safe
        packaging and enforced health and safety standards similar to those
        governing food products.

        FDACS has been vigilant in enforcing these measures, conducting
        extensive inspections of businesses selling hemp-extract products.
        The department's efforts included examining over 700 establishments
        across all 67 Florida counties, uncovering a substantial number—more
        than 107,400—of attractively packaged hemp products.

        Florida's proactive steps in reforming hemp laws and implementing
        stringent regulations exemplify a robust commitment to ensuring consumer
        safety and shielding children from potentially harmful substances. This
        crackdown underscores the state's dedication to adapt and fortify
        regulatory frameworks in response to evolving market dynamics and
        emerging challenges.

        # New Florida Regulations with SB66 now active.

        ## Navigating the New Florida SB66 Hemp Bill: What Retailers Need to Know

        Florida's rapidly growing hemp industry has been buzzing with the
        introduction of the new SB66 Hemp Bill. This legislation is essential
        for retailers to understand as it sets the groundwork for the
        standardization and regulation of hemp products in the Sunshine State.
        This post will help demystify the key aspects of this bill, with a
        special focus on the packaging and labeling regulations critical for
        retailers.

        ## Florida SB66 Hemp Bill at a Glance
        At its core, the SB66 Hemp Bill provides guidelines on the cultivation,
        production, and sale of hemp products in Florida. It strives to create
        an industry standard, ensuring safety and transparency for consumers,
        while also aligning with federal regulations.

        ## Packaging & Labeling: The Heart of the Matter

        One of the standout sections of this bill, particularly for retailers,
        is the detailed guidelines for packaging and labeling of hemp products.
        Here's a breakdown:

        ### 3. e. 2. Distributing or Selling in a Specified Container

        When distributing or selling hemp products, the container must have:

        a. A scannable barcode or quick response code (QR code) which links to
        the certificate of analysis. This analysis should be carried out by an
        independent testing laboratory for the hemp extract batch.
        b. The batch number, crucial for traceability and quality control.
        c. An internet address where more detailed batch information can be found.
        d. The expiration date of the product.
        e. Detailed information on the number of milligrams of each marketed 
        cannabinoid per serving.

        ### 3. e. 3. Specific Container Requirements

        Furthermore, the hemp product container must:

        a. Be fit for containing products intended for human consumption.

        b. Be made of materials that reduce exposure to light, thus preserving
        the product's quality.

        c. Minimize exposure to high temperatures, again ensuring the hemp
        product remains at its best.

        d. Not be designed in a way that it's attractive to children,
        emphasizing safety.

        e. Comply with the United States Poison Prevention Packaging Act of
        1970. This is a key federal requirement to ensure child safety.

        ## The U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 Explained

        Enacted in 1970, the United States Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA)
        was designed to reduce the risk of children ingesting hazardous
        substances. The Act mandates that certain household substances,
        including prescription drugs, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, and now
        certain hemp products, be packaged in child-resistant packaging.

        Child-resistant packaging, as defined by the PPPA, is designed to be
        significantly challenging for children under five years of age to
        open within a reasonable amount of time, but not for adults. For a
        package to be considered child-resistant, it must pass a series of
        tests that assess its effectiveness in preventing child access.

        ## Child-Resistant Packaging in Florida's Hemp Industry

        With the integration of the PPPA into the SB66 Hemp Bill, there's a
        clear message: the safety of children is paramount. The emphasis is on
        preventing accidental ingestion of hemp products, especially given the
        rise of edibles and other consumables that might be mistakenly perceived
        as regular food or candy by a child.

        ## What This Means for Retailers:

        - Evaluation of Current Packaging: Retailers must assess their current
        hemp product packaging to determine if it meets child-resistant
        standards as outlined in the PPPA. This might mean liaising with
        suppliers or seeking expert guidance to ascertain compliance.

        - Building Trust: Emphasizing the use of child-resistant packaging can
        be a trust-building measure. By highlighting this aspect, retailers can
        position themselves as responsible and consumer-centric businesses.

        ## Conclusion: Prioritizing Safety in the Hemp Industry
        The inclusion of child-resistant packaging requirements, as inspired by
        the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act, in Florida's SB66 Hemp Bill,
        is a progressive step. It not only underscores the importance of child
        safety but also challenges retailers to be more responsible and diligent.
        As the hemp industry in Florida continues to grow, regulations like
        these ensure it does so with the utmost regard for community and
        consumer safety.

        The 2023 Farm Bill, Let's cement Delta 8 THC's status! Call for Action
        on the 2023 Farm Bill.

        Dear Industry insiders,

        I know your inboxs can sometimes get flooded with sales emails, so this
        is aimed at providing important and interesting information as state and
        national rules change or evolve, ideally before it happens.

        Rather than just your usual marketing spin at Frozen Fields we believe
        in sharing our market knowledge with our customers, new, old and future.
        We will keep you posted in these newsletters as things develop in DC as
        well as any state level changes you need to be aware of. If you need a
        legal letter explaining the legal status to Delta 8 THC please email
        marketing@frozenfields.live and we will be happy to provide. 

        I am hoping to draw your attention to an unfolding chapter in our field,
        notably the “Alternate Cannabinoid” segment of the Hemp Industry where we
        collectively strive for excellence.

        The much-anticipated 2023 Farm Bill, originally set for September but now
        poised to unfold in 2024, presents us with a momentous juncture. This
        legislation harbors the potential to unlock vast opportunities for our
        industry, which we've been diligently building since the 2018 Farm Bill.

        Having observed the ebb and flow of multiple bills at the state level,
        we're now turning our gaze to Washington. The arena might be larger,
        with high-stake interests, but it also provides an unparalleled
        platform to impact the industry we hold dear.

        It's worth noting that it's a lot more challenging to make an activity
        illegal than it is to legalize it in the first place. This gives us a
        strong footing, but we should not underestimate the gravity of the
        situation. Our opposition comprises formidable entities like MSO cannabis
        operators, state regulator associations, and seasoned Anti-Drug
        campaigners.

        Despite the challenges, our sector, while somewhat dispersed, possesses
        an indomitable spirit and the ability to rally when needed. The focus so
        far has been primarily on state-level politics, but now it's time to
        address the broader picture. Together, we can harness the momentum
        gained during the state legislative sessions to advocate for our
        industry on the national stage.

        While there is speculation about potential changes to hemp regulations
        in the Farm Bill, the most likely scenario points towards maintenance
        of the status quo, as the USDA typically refrains from drastic
        legislative alterations. However, we'll have a clearer perspective once
        the first draft surfaces, anticipated before this year concludes.

        In the interim, I urge you to support industry stalwarts like the Hemp
        Roundtable and the Health Alternatives Association. Their tireless
        efforts provide invaluable support at the grassroots level, and we may
        need to amplify our collective voice when the time comes.

        Let's remain vigilant, engaged, and ready to navigate the tides of
        change. The future of our industry is ripe with promise, and our shared
        commitment and unity will ensure we continue riding this wave of
        progress.
