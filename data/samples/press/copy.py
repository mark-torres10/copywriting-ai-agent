        The pursuit of the perfect high is not something cannabinoid technicians
        take lightly. Once you get in amongst the molecules, the majesty of their
        long-chain carbon structures is all you think about. That's been the
        forensic focus of Frozen Fields' scientific lead Andrew Barton for the
        last few years. Barton's work with live resin extraction in his lab in
        Oregon means he now holds a pending patent for a cannabinoid delivery
        system called Formula-X, and it is making waves in both the wellness and
        recreational cannabis categories.

        “Formula-X is an enhanced delivery system created through a proprietary
        processing technique where we can condense cannabinoids with components
        of terpenes in cannabis,” says Barton, “ultimately delivering a faster
        onset with longer-lasting effects.” 

        Formula-X is a new, highly bioavailable form of Delta-8 THC developed
        by the team at Frozen Fields, led by Barton. Frozen Fields' Formula-X
        is more easily absorbed by the body and provides an almost instantaneous
        effect. This proprietary process makes Formula-X experiences vivid and
        more euphoric than anything previously seen in the alternative cannabis
        category. These condensed cannabinoids have special solubility qualities
        and improved transportation in the body, helping the other cannabinoids
        or molecules in Frozen Fields' product have a greater impact via this
        enhanced delivery system, carrying them quicker and delivering them to
        the receptors faster. 

        Formula-X is blended in unique formulations to give consumers the
        desired Indica, Sativa, or Hybrid effect. 

        Sativa: "This is our fast-acting and uplifting blend, says Barton.
        Our patent-pending blend delivers a profound sense of energy - a friendly
        blast of get up and go - before you settle back into a richly rewarding
        experience. This is the Sativa effect, but with the unique fuller, faster,
        feel-good factor of Formula-X. Formula-X along with other condensed
        cannabinoids, are Patent Pending and will be used exclusively in Frozen
        Fields products." 

        Indica: "Our Indica blend has a euphoric onset followed by complete
        relaxation. You get the feel-good factor as you experience exhilaration
        before settling into the sublime state you would expect from a true Indica." 

        Hybrid: "Finally, this one's a remix of our Indica and Sativa. A true
        Hybrid with the fast-acting and uplifting effects of our Sativa blend
        and the relaxation and euphoric nature of our lndica blend, creating a
        well-rounded experience for someone looking for a go-to product for
        all-day use. I'm proud of our three blends," says Barton with a smile
        on his face like that of a proud parent. 

        The difference between Formula-X and traditional cannabis extracts is
        the size and nature of the nanoparticles, which have an easier time
        getting where they need to go and are better able to exert their effects.
        Formula-X nanoparticles travel dissolved in terpenes, naturally
        occurring chemical compounds in plants responsible for the aromas,
        flavors, and colors associated with various vegetation types.

        Formula-X nanoparticles take more force to move than the terpenes they
        are dissolved in. This means that water repels them at a different rate
        than the terpenes, making it easy for the body to separate them
        individually. Their tiny (nanoscale) size means they are easily
        suspended in water, allowing the body to transport them immediately in
        large quantities. Their tiny size also means they quickly "settle" on
        their targets, enhancing their effects.

        If that feels like a lot of science, we asked Andrew Barton if he has
        an everyday, real-world analogy:

        “When the body absorbs materials that don't dissolve in water, it uses
        a variety of bio-molecules to break the materials into smaller and
        smaller pieces. Once the pieces are small enough, they can be suspended 
        in water and transported throughout the body. You can think of this
        process as being like rocks in a river. The current doesn't move the
        biggest rocks; the water moves around them. As the rocks get smaller,
        they move increasingly with the current. Small rocks get pushed around
        where the current is fastest, shaping the bottom of the stream. Gravel
        moves farther, filling in the empty spaces between small rocks. Like in
        the body, the smaller the particles are, the farther they travel, and
        the better they fill small spaces when they settle.”

        Smaller particles moving further get into more places, causing an
        enhanced effect. That's the Formula-X Feel Good Factor. 

        All of this cutting-edge science begins on the 45 parallel in Oregon
        near the banks of the Deschutes River. The 45th parallel is known to
        have the best terroir for growing cannabis. Frozen Fields' hemp is grown
        near beautiful Bend, Oregon, halfway between the North Pole and the
        Equator. Oregon State University Global Hemp Innovation Center has
        confirmed this location to be an ideal climate for growing this amazing
        plant. This is partly thanks to its rich volcanic soil, which ensures
        dense, trichome-full flower that is virtually indistinguishable from
        high-end medical cannabis varieties.

        "Our development team has mixed these new cannabinoid molecules in
        different quantities to mimic an Indica, Sativa, or Hybrid effect with
        the enhanced bioavailability of Formula-X," says Frozen Fields CRO
        Koby Licciardo. "We're utilizing cutting-edge advancements in the
        hemp-derived category to craft an experience mimicking traditional
        cannabis. The key difference is Formula-X means you have a virtually
        instantaneous effect followed by a longer, stronger, smoother journey.
        All of this begins with a quality live resin extract flash frozen at
        precisely the right moment.
